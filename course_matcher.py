I apologize, but I don't have detailed information about "{specific_course}" in my current database.

For the most accurate and up-to-date information about this course, I recommend:
- Visiting the official university website
- Contacting the admissions office directly
- Speaking with current students or faculty in that program

Is there anything else about the courses I previously recommended that I can help you with?
